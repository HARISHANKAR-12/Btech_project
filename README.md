# Automation of Abrasive Cutting Machine

### Abrasive Cutting Machine

Abrasive cutting machines use a rotating abrasive wheel to cut hard materials by grinding rather than conventional sawing or chipping.
They are designed primarily for cutting metals, ceramics, composites, and other tough materials
The abrasive wheel is made of coarse particles like aluminum oxide, silicon carbide, or diamond, bonded together in a matrix
It produces clean cuts with minimal burr and reduced finishing work.
